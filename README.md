# freeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithm challenges

This is a repository for our weekly challenges found in our FB group: [freeCodeCamp Greater Sacramento Area](https://www.facebook.com/groups/free.code.camp.sacramento/)

Below you find various algorithms ranging from easy to hard with the answers provided. But first, let's cover the rules!

1. Follow the instructions carefully!
2. No sharing code until you've completed the challenge.
3. You may ask for help and if you've got help from someone, tag them and give them appreciation.
4. If you found help outside of this group, share the link along with your answer.

**Given an array of numbers, find the largest value and console.log it using either a for-loop or a while-loop. (Date: 03/07/2018)**

**Given an array of values, write a function that returns a reversed version of the array. (Date: 03/08/2018)**

Easy: Use a loop, and do not mutate the original array.

Medium: Reverse the array in place. This should mutate the original array, and should not use the built in Array.reverse() method.

Hard: Reverse the array in place, but you are not allowed to create any additional variables to store values or use the built in Array.reverse().

**Given an input number `n`, write a function `fib(n)` that returns the nth Fibonacci number. (Date: 03/12/2018)**

The Fibonacci sequence is a pattern where the first two numbers in the sequence are 1 and 1, then each successive number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two numbers. Thus, the 3rd number is 1 + 1 = 2, the 4th is 1 + 2 = 3, the 5th is 2 + 3 = 5, the 6th is 3 + 5 = 8, and so on.

So, the sequence looks like this: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, ...

Your task is to write a function that takes a number `n` as an input, and returns the nth Fibonacci number. For example, fib(6) should return 8, since 8 is the 6th Fibonacci number.

**Given an input string of numeric digits, write a function `prettyPrint()` that returns a version formatted like a phone number. (Date: 03/15/2018)**

A common feature of phone number input boxes on web forms is pretty printing - for example, when a user enters "9165551234", what gets displayed is "(916) 555-1234".

Write a function called prettyPrint() that takes a string of digits, and meets the following conditions:

1) If there are exactly 10 digits, return a pretty printed version of the digits, as in "(XXX) XXX-XXXX".

2) Otherwise, return the digits as is.

*Extra Credit*

Enable the function to ignore any non-numeric characters in the input string.
