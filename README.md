**Given an array of values, write a function that returns a reversed version of the array. (Date: 03/08/2018)**

Easy: Use a loop, and do not mutate the original array.

Medium: Reverse the array in place. This should mutate the original array, and should not use the built in Array.reverse() method.

Hard: Reverse the array in place, but you are not allowed to create any additional variables to store values or use the built in Array.reverse().
